# Chat-Room-Application
This application is using python language. Also, using python socket and still doesn't has GUI yet. The Chat Room Application is like client-server. So, which mean it containts "Server" side that will receive every client connections that connected to the chat room and send / delivery every messages that received from client side. Then, "Client" side is like what we know as user that using the app for chatting or sending messages to the other user without knowing what happened behind the application or in the server side.

# Requirements
The requirements for this application is just need a  "Command Prompt", "Git Bash", or any kind of cmd.

# Steps
Steps for execute or run the app:
1. Download the file or source code of "server_chatroom.py" and "client_chatroom.py".
2. Open your cmd (Command Prompt).
3. Cd / Move to the location where the python file has been saved before.
4. Then type "python server_chatroom.py" for execute / run the server side.
5. Repeat the steps 2 and 3. Then, type "python client_chatroom.py" for execute / run the client side.
6. Then, type something in client side for chatting or sending messages.

# Note
This app can handle multi chat clients. So, you can create many clients with cmd as you want and type anything you want in there. Also, clients can't chat or send messages directly to the other clients. So, that's why it need a server to pass / delivery the messages to the other clients in chat room. Thank you, hope this helping you guys and sorry if this app is not perfect or not like what you guys expected.
